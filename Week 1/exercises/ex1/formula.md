The formulas for EBT (Earnings Before Tax) and profit are essential for financial analysis and determining the financial health of a business. Here are both:

### 1. **EBT (Earnings Before Tax) Formula**:
EBT is calculated as the operating profit of a company minus interest expenses.

\[
\text{EBT} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Operating Expenses} - \text{Interest Expenses}
\]

Or, it can also be expressed as:

\[
\text{EBT} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Taxes}
\]

This formula is used to determine how much income a company generates before paying taxes.

### 2. **Profit Formula**:
There are different types of profit calculations depending on what level of profit you're calculating. The most common is **Net Profit**, which accounts for all expenses, including taxes.

\[
\text{Profit (Net Profit)} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Expenses}
\]

Where total expenses include:
- Operating Expenses
- Interest Expenses
- Taxes

Alternatively:

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{EBT} - \text{Taxes}
\]

This gives the final earnings after all expenses are deducted, which is the profit a company retains.

If you're calculating **Gross Profit**:

\[
\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}
\]

Gross profit represents the profit before operating expenses, interest, and taxes are deducted.
